Assignments for the Masters (BME) course Biostatistics (201400285)

### Course Content

Central concepts of probability theory like (conditional) probability, expectation and variance are treated. Also the calculation of expectations and variances of linear functions of the observations is a topic of the course and this topic ends with principal components. The principles of statistical testing theory are explained considering the case of one sample (discrete and continuous data). Statistical tests are focused towards: the comparison of two samples, regression, analysis of variances (including repeated measures) and logistic regression. Within analysis of variance we spend some time on multiple comparison / post hoc analysis / simultaneous confidence intervals.
